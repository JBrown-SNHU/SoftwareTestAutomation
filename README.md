Question: How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

One way I can ensure that I write secure code and programs is to create test cases for my program using both black-box and white-box testing methods. Though it may be impossible to show 100% test coverage for a program, I can make sure that I test my program for known problems such as border cases, and above all, make sure my code does everything that it's supposed to do, and nothing that it isn't. I've learned through this course and project that it can be hard to dissect your own code due to personal bias being the developer. As a result, it can greatly benefit having a separate person to test the code who won't show the same bias as the developer to ensure that code works as intended.

Question: How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The system requirements are our primary method of determining the users' needs in any project, and as a result, it is a good idea to design the code with requirements at the forefront of designing. In fact, tests should also be designed with the requirements in mind; doing so leaves no room for error when testing. It can also be a great idea to design test cases before the actual coding begins. This method will allow developers to write code to fit the mold of the test cases, leaving little room for error and/or failed interpretation.

Question: How do I approach designing software?

I should always approach software development like there is something on the line. Computers and software encompasses so many aspects of our everyday lives; it is important to realize that mistakes and errors in my code may very well affect someone's livelihood or even their very life. With that being said, releasing buggy code or not prefomring the proper test to make sure the software operates as intended is absolutely unacceptable as a software developer.
